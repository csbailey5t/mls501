## Materials for MLS501 at NCSU

This repository contains presentation and R activity materials for a class session for MLS501 at NC State University, focused on the collection and use of social media, with a particular eye to ward surveillance. 

The presentation and activity are modifications of a version offered a couple of years prior by Alison Blain and Markus Wust when they were at NC State Libraries.
