## Materials for MLS501 at NCSU

This repository contains presentation and R activity materials for a class session for MLS501 at NC State University, focused on the collection and use of social media, with a particular eye to ward surveillance. 

The repository includes a random sample of 50k tweets from the Covid-19 Twitter dataset here: https://github.com/echen102/COVID-19-TweetIDs. Tweet IDs would need to be rehydrated using DocNow's Hydrator or another tool.

The presentation and activity are modifications of a version offered a couple of years prior by Alison Blain and Markus Wust when they were at NC State Libraries.
